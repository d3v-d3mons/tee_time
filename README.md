# Tee Time

Tee Time is an app for the amatuer golfer. Anyone who wants a clean and simple scorecard to track a weekend game with their buddies can do so with this free, straightforward, and intuitive app. Simply sign up, create a game, add players, and you're all set!


The motivation for this project was to solve a problem with current scorecard apps. Most apps on the market are catered towards more serious golfers and are either loaded with extra features that only overcomplicate the experience for the casual golfer or are hidden behind a paywell. Our app keeps solves this by being simple, and most importantly, free. Tee Time is made by amatuer golfers for amatuer golfers!
